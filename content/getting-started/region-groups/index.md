Head over to Fauna dashboard and select *Create Database*. Notice that you have an option called region group. Region groups give you control over where your data resides. This capability makes it possible to comply with data locality legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe while benefiting from Faunaâ€™s distributed service features.
