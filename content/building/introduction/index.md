## Learning goals

* Connect to Fauna from a Next.js application using GraphQL.
* Implement user authentication and access control in your app.
* Retrieve and store data in your application using GraphQL and Fauna.

## Pre-requisites

* A Fauna account. You can [sign up for an account][fauna-signup] and complete this workshop using Fauna's free tier.
* Some familiarity with GraphQL. Visit [Introduction to GraphQL][graphql-learn] to learn more.
* [Node.js][node.js] version 14 or later.
* Complete the first chapter of this workshop, [*Getting started with Fauna*]({{< ref "/getting-started" >}}).

{{% notice note %}}
We suggest completing the first chapter of this workshop before proceeding with this chapter, even if you have already built applications with GraphQL and Fauna. The first chapter provides both foundational knowledge and some suggested practices that we believe help users build more effectively with Fauna.
