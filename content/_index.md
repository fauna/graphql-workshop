Hypothesis 1: Uploading the GraphQL schema and seeing the auto-generated queries and mutations is the "aha" moment we're looking for. Nothing should slow down getting the user to that "aha" moment.

Hypothesis 2: Speed to delivery of custom functionality (resolver) is so much greater than with Mongo, Lambda functions, etc. Hasura, et al, require you to run a Postgres server. "Ain't nobody got time for that" -- Shadid. This is the second "aha" moment.

If we want to do a backend/FQL-only track we can make that a separate language.
