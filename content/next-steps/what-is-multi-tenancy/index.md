Siloed Database Multi-tenancy is an architecture pattern in which each vendor (tenant) has the flexibility to put their data in an isolated database instance. This is in contrast to a Shared Multi-tenancy model, in which tenants share the same set of tables, but are logically separated by application logic. For the purposes of this workshop, we will be implementing the siloed model. For brevity, we henceforth simply just refer to it as Database Multitenancy.

### Advantages of Multi-tenancy

Database multi-tenancy makes it impossible for one tenant to view another tenantâ€™s data due to a bug in the application layer or something similar. When you have a multi-tenant (multi-vendor) SaaS application, it correctly estimates which tenants are using how much of your database resources. 

Therefore, multi-tenancy can help you make valuable business decisions as well. Moreover, multi-tenancy makes data compliance easy.

### Disadvantages of Multi-tenancy

The main drawback of multi-tenancy is the initial investment. However, you can significantly cut down on this initial investment when you use a serverless managed database service like Fauna.
