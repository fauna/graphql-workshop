Database Multi-tenancy is an architecture pattern in which each vendor (tenant) has the flexibility to put their data in an isolated database instance.

### Advantages of Multi-tenancy

Database multi-tenancy makes it impossible for one tenant to view another tenantâ€™s data due to a bug in the application layer or something similar. When you have a multi-tenant (multi-vendor) SaaS application, it correctly estimates which tenants are using how much of your database resources. 

Therefore, multi-tenancy can help you make valuable business decisions as well. Moreover, multi-tenancy makes data compliance easy.

### Disadvantages of Multi-tenancy

The main drawback of multi-tenancy is the initial investment. However, you can significantly cut down on this initial investment when you use a serverless managed database service like Fauna.
